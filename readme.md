I used the hamburger button on my nav bar and set it to open when clicked when using a phone or other small screen device.
When the hamburger button is clicked the nav bar opens and there is a drop down menu for navigating to the other pages with this website. 

When this page is viewed on a medium sized screen (768px) or larger the hamburger button disappears and the nav bar shows all of the pages on a horizontal bar. 


The footer is set up using flex box.
On small screens the footer links are stacked on top of each other in a single column covering 100% of the screen.
 When using medium screens with a minimum width of 768px the footer is in two columns each taking up 50% of the screen .
 On large screens with a min width of  1024px the footer is in 4 columns each taking up 25% of the screen. 


I orginally used a standard pop up window to accept cookies when first arrving to the page. I used session storage to save the accept click so that every time you navigated to the home page you would have to accept the cookies. 
I did not like the look of this pop up so I switced to a banner cookie consent.

I was able to use CSS to stylize this banner. 
When the okay button is clicked this action is saved in local storage.  In order for the banner to show again, local storage must be cleared and the page refreshed to see the cookie banner. 


In the footer for the copyright date, the date will be updated with java script on January 1 of every year so that the year is up to date.
